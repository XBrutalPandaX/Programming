# Classes and Objects 
## OOP Principles
Class consists of data members and member functions. A Calss defines new programmer defined data type. Once defined it can be used to create object of that type. Class is a template for an object, and an object is instance of a class. 

object -> instance

object 
* object- have state and behaviour. 
* Class - is a template or blueprint of an object 
* Method - is a behaviour. 
* Instance Variable - An object is created by the values assigned to these instance variable 
```java
class classname{
    //type instance-variable1;
    type methodname1(){
        //body of method
    }
}
```

## Instantiation 
Data defined in a class is instance variable.      
When we want to access data members or methods of a class we have ot write    
objecname.mebername(dot operator);
